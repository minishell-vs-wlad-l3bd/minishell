# LIBFT_42
libft is a personal or educational project commonly associated with the 42 School curriculum. It's a custom implementation of some of the most frequently used functions in the C standard library. The idea behind creating a libft is to help students get more familiar with C programming by building and understanding the fundamental components of the language.

What does libft usually include?
libft typically consists of the following:

1.String functions:

ft_strlen(), ft_strcpy(), ft_strcat(), etc.
These are implementations of standard string manipulation functions from the C library (like strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), etc.), written from scratch.

2.Memory functions:

ft_memset(), ft_memcpy(), ft_memmove(), etc.
These mimic memory manipulation functions like memset(), memcpy(), memmove(), etc.

3.Character functions:

ft_isalpha(), ft_isdigit(), ft_isalnum(), etc.
These replicate functions that check the properties of characters, like isalpha(), isdigit(), etc.

4.Other utility functions:

ft_atoi(), ft_strdup(), ft_itoa(), etc.
These are often custom implementations of utility functions like atoi(), strdup(), itoa(), etc.

4.Linked lists (optional but common):

Some versions of libft include implementations for basic data structures like linked lists (t_list), with functions for adding, removing, or traversing nodes.
Why is libft important?
Learning experience: It helps students get hands-on practice with core programming concepts like memory management, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking.
Reusability: The goal is to create a reusable library of functions that can later be used in other projects.
No reliance on standard library: In some cases, students are required to write their own implementations of functions instead of using the built-in ones to deepen their understanding of how things work "under the hood."
In short, libft is a small library of foundational C functions that serves both as an educational tool and as a personal project for students learning C programming.
